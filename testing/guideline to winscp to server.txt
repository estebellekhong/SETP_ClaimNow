In order to rund the web site, all code should copy into the htdocs/claimnow directory

You can check the web view for code: 34.87.75.110/claimnow 
To access database please use: 34.87.75.110/phpmyadmin

To able to copy your code into the server, you'll need the file transfer software.
I recommend to use WinSCP:
1. Install winscp 
2. In Winscp from menu: Session->Sites->Site Manager
3. Create New Site
	Host name= 34.87.75.110
	port = 22
	username= shinkage889
	3.1 Click Advance Site Setting 
	3.2 click SSH->Authentication
	3.3 in private key file, select "claimnow.ppk" from directory path where you keep the key file. 
	3.4 Click Ok
4. Click Login 

Remark: Every time you login please download the entire code before editing to prevent overwritten production code with older code in you local directory. 

Please make sure you upload code files into "/opt/lampp/htdocs/claimnow" in the  remote site.
